## Welcome

Hey, I am Sonny and this is (obviously) the source code of my portfolio website!

## Getting Started

This project uses Bun instead of Node. To get started run:

```bash
bun install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
